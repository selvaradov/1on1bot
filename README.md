# 1on1 Bot
A discord bot that pairs up users within a server for weekly 1-1 calls. 
Used by Atlas Fellows and SPARC2024 attendees. 
## Installation
Click [this link](https://discord.com/oauth2/authorize?client_id=1281095060418727979) to add the bot to a server you are an administrator on. It will ask for the following permissions:
- Manage roles
  - To create a new 1-1 role, and add/remove it from users as they join/leave
- Manage channels
  - To create a channel for 1-1s to happen in
- Send messages
  - To notify users about the weekly pairings
- Send reactions
  - To add an ‚ùå emoji to the opt-out message

*If you already have a role on the server called "1-1", please ensure you either remove that role or move the "1-1 Bot" role above it before anybody tries to join the 1-1 programme, or there will be permission issues.*

## Functions
1. **/join:** add the user to the 1-1 programme.
2. **/leave:** remove the user from the 1-1 programme, while retaining a copy of their 10 most recent partners.
3. **/change-frequency:** change the user's meeting frequency to once every n weeks; default is once every week.
4. **/add-preferred-partner:** suggest a person the user would like to meet.
5. **/add-previous-partner:** manually add a person to the user's list of 10 most recent partners; normally done automatically after every meeting.
6. **/check-current-partner:** return the user's current partner.
7. **/check-previous-partners:** return the user's 10 most recent partners.
8. **/pair:** admin function; manually run the pairing function; normally done automatically every Monday.
9. **/debug:** admin function; return the values of the programme's arrays.
10. **/kick:** admin function; remove another user from the 1-1 programme.  
11. **optout:** send a message 48 hours in advance, which allows users to opt-out for a week by reacting to it. 
## FAQ
#### Q: Do you have any planned updates?
A: Small group meeting, feedback mechanism (including whether the 1:1 actually happened, so we can nudge people who're enrolled but don't participate), and handling pairing across multiple servers to avoid duplicates.
## Areas to develop
### Handling of frequencies
The code is configured so that when somebody joins they immediately get a partner if possible. But say they only want fortnightly meetings, if they're matched up in the first week and the next week is even, perhaps they'll be paired two weeks in a row -- so we might need an offset property? (this may be overly complex though). Equally, maybe somebody doesn't get paired up immediately, the next week is odd, then they will go for two whole weeks without a pair. So we want to deal with this too (and in the general case of frequency n).

One problem with this is that two people who set fortnightly frequency and join in consecutive weeks will never be paired up with each other. Giving everybody an offset of zero avoids this.
